        As the coronavirus sparked a new environment of campaign culture on
        TikTok and changed the way brands connect with consumers, this study
        aimed to understand how brands have successfully used TikTok to their
        advantage. The motivations of each brand to carry out specific video
        content and campaigns on this social media platform is relevant to both
        their personal missions and how they attempt to take creative risks. The
        brands analyzed in the qualitative case study are notable and highly
        regarded on TikTok because they both share a balance between having fun,
        fostering a community, and bringing to light fresh content and
        perspectives that emotionally resonate with a widespread audience.This
        qualitative research was conducted over the course of one semester. That
        four-month time frame limited the number of campaigns that could be
        analyzed. As a result, only two campaigns were examined. Future research
        could consider similar campaigns on TikTok or observe how influencers
        specifically are communicating successful brand partner messages on the
        platform, and how corporations and businesses can use this different
        marketing avenue. In addition, future research could also investigate
        the consumer perspective on a national or international scale,
        interviewing consumers of different demographics. This study indicates
        that brands can successfully use the TikTok space to create unique
        campaigns, messages, and content to untapped audiences with the right
        strategy

        The strategy works because being on trend is key to operating on TikTok
        and many other social networks. This means that brands need to
        understand standards, trends, inside jokes and other nuances before they
        post. Otherwise, they run the risk of appearing inauthentic - one of the
        biggest online errors, and a quick way to lose audience trust. While
        already an established source of information, using TikTok to share in
        ways that appeal to younger audiences has created a cult-like following
        for the newspaper, allowing it to connect with a new segment of its
        audience, allowing for The Washington Post to be one of the largest, and
        most reputable, TikTok giants. Jorgenson noted: “We’re slowly kind of
        proving to them that their [young users’] perception of The Washington
        Post - wherever they got it from, if it was negative - now they’re
        looking at our TikTok, and they’re saying, ‘This is not what I expected,
        but in the best way’” (Tenbarge, 2019). The Washington Post makes clear
        that brands can use TikTok to give an unexpected audience a comedic and
        authentic experience into who they are. The brand took creative risks
        and had fun in the process
